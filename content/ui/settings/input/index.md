The topic of input settings can often be deeply linked to the conversation of accessibility. Be sure to check out the documentation around [Motor Controls]({{< ref "accessibility#motor-controls" >}}) to make a fully formed decision around what your game should support.

## Remap Support

[Not all players' hands and motor skills are equal]({{< ref "/accessibility/motor" >}}), additionally, not all players' devices or peripherals are equal either. This is why it can often be incredibly import to support key remapping, particularly if your game has a large number of controls or has input that requires a good deal of stretching[^crouch].

[^crouch]: I'm looking at you `ctrl` for crouch

Presets are useful, particularly for saving effort configuring commonly used button layouts. But they cannot provide for all needs, so ideally offer both – a set of profiles together with a “custom” option, which allows full remapping.

There is a common misconception that remappable controls result in TCR/TRC certification issues. This is not true. It does not, for example, affect requirements about X/O use, or about multiple triggers.

Consoles now provide remapping at system level. In-game remapping has many benefits over it, for example allowing in-game prompts to reflect the current mapping, being able to map different classes or walking/driving separately, and even the simple usability of the settings being where players expect to find them, rather than hidden away in a platform system menu. System level remap is provided as a safety net, not as a substitute for providing remap in-game.
