# Common Options

### Music Volume

A critical option, provides the ability to control the volume for all music related audio in the game.

### Sound Effects Volume

Identical to [music volume](#music-volume), but for non-music related audio. Unless you plan on splitting sound effects further by category (voices, UI sounds, etc) it's a safe bet to control all sound effect volume through this option.

### Master Volume

A common and desired option for most games is a master volume option. This option should have an effect on all audio sources for the game and will usually tie directly into the game engine's master volume mixer.
