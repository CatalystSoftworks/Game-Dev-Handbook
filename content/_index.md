This document is still in its early days of development. Therefore there are several sections that are stubbed out and awaiting further content to be added.

This handbook is an living document being curated by [Catalyst Softworks](https://catalystsoftworks.com) as a way to distill the collective game development knowledge of the team into a single resource. Though this is intended to be an internal resource, we have decided to allow for it to be publicly accessible in hopes of helping others better realize their own visions and goals.
