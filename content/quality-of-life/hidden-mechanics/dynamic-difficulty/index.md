title: Dynamic Difficulty
---

# Overview

The topic of difficulty can be a rather contentious conversation, often breaking down into a debate over the developer's _intended_ experience vs the player's experience. However, **no consumer wants to purchase a product they can't use**. Inversely, if a player is breezing through the challenges presented they may feel it's too easy to feel rewarding and may get bored by the lack of challenge.

This is why several games introduce sneaky mechanics that coerce the challenges of the game to adhere to a player's capabilities based on their performance. The benefit of this that you don't need to tailor numbers to a preset range of "easy to hard" difficulty settings - rather, you can send the player down the intended experience and make adjustments to that experience using a variety of other systems and techniques.

If a player is getting repeatedly stuck in a particular area, start removing the element that is causing them to get stuck. If they just can't solve a puzzle, move pieces/clues to more obvious locations for them to "discover on their own". If the enemies they're encountering are just too easy, give the enemies a slight buff or spawn a stronger enemy to mix up the challenge.

## Examples in Games

### Resident Evil 4

If the player is accurate and takes only a few hits, the enemies will automatically become more aggressive and deal more damage, but if the player is missing a lot of shots or getting hit too many times and dying, the enemies will become more passive, deal less damage and sometimes not even spawn.

One example for this is during the gondola area in the village, if Leon takes enough hits at this part, the two archers will not spawn at the water room. This dynamic difficulty is turned off in Professional modes and the enemies are on a set aggressive manner that cannot be changed.

### Final Fantasy 8

The levels for most enemies scale with your own. That is, they will become stronger as you become stronger. Furthermore, they improve at a higher rate than you, so while a level 5 character can take on a level 5 enemy rather easily, a level 30 character will have a lot of trouble defeating a level 30 enemy. You can compensate for this somewhat through junctioning, but it can still present a challenge. Enemies also see a huge jump in strength at levels 10 and 30, so you'll do best to keep your characters lower than that.
